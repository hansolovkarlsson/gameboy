# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Start here

`scratch/daily-standup.md` — written at the end of the previous working day to
be read at the start of the next: where the tree was left, what went in, and
what is outstanding. `scratch/` is gitignored and is not part of this
repository, so the file is absent on a fresh clone and on any day that was not
closed out. When it is absent, `git log` and the documents named below are the
way in.

## Project

A Game Boy emulator written in C - both the original DMG (the 1989
monochrome hardware) and the Game Boy Color (CGB).
Originally developed as a subproject inside a Z80/CP-M emulator repo,
then split out into this standalone repo (via `git subtree split`,
preserving its real commit history) once it became clear the two
shared no code at all - see `docs/GAMEBOY_ROADMAP.md`'s "Architecture
decision" section for the reasoning, and its Status section (near the
end) for the split itself. Comments throughout this codebase still cite
`cpm/...` paths from that sibling Z80/CP-M repo (a separate GitHub
repository now, not a directory here) where a design decision was
genuinely compared against or modeled on that project's own approach -
those citations are accurate as "this is the real prior art", just no
longer "elsewhere in this same repo".

Three reference docs live in `docs/` (the day-to-day records are the
section below): `GAMEBOY_ROADMAP.md` (project status by
phase - what's done, what's next, and the honest reasoning/evidence
behind every fix, not just a checklist), `CPU_REFERENCE.md` (the SM83
instruction set, including how and where it genuinely differs from a
real Z80), and `HARDWARE_REFERENCE.md` (the DMG hardware spec this
emulator targets - memory map, cartridge/MBC banking, PPU, APU, timer,
joypad - each claim grounded against a real, cited pandocs page, not
guessed). This file (`CLAUDE.md`) covers build/run/test commands and
day-to-day conventions; read the roadmap for *why* something is
implemented the way it is.

## The records

In `docs/`: **`GAMEBOY_ROADMAP.md` is two records in one file** — its `Phases`
section is what is left, its `Status` section is what exists and the evidence
for it, and that section also holds every postmortem entry written before
`POSTMORTEM.md` was split out. `POSTMORTEM.md` scores mistakes and predictions
from that point on. **`work-journal/` is a directory** — a day gets a new dated
file in it, not an append to a single page. `CHANGELOG.md` says when something
shipped, for a reader who is not reading the source.

Each of those opens with a note stating its own job. That note is the
specification for what belongs in it — follow it over any general instruction.
The journal's note lives once in `work-journal/README.md` rather than in every
dated file.

These four are `nav_exclude`d in `docs/_config.yml`: `docs/` is the published
GitHub Pages site, so anything added there is built and reachable even when it
is not in the sidebar. Write them for whoever works on the emulator, and assume
they can be read.

## Build & Run

```
make                    # builds bin/gameboy (the core --ppm/--wav/--input driver)
make test               # alias for gameboy-test -- the name tooling looks for
make gameboy-test       # build + run every direct, ROM-independent unit test
make gameboy-visual-test    # dmg-acid2: render a frame, compare pixel-for-pixel
make gameboy-2048-test      # 2048-gb: scripted play, byte-exact frame regression
make gameboy-droneboy-test  # Droneboy: byte-exact audio regression
make gameboy-tobu-test      # Tobu Tobu Girl: byte-exact frame regression
make gameboy-savestate-test # real-ROM save/load round-trip, byte-exact
make gameboy-rgbds-test        # opt-in, needs `brew install rgbds`
make gameboy-rgbds-mbc3-test   # opt-in, needs `brew install rgbds`
make gameboy-sdl        # opt-in, needs SDL2 (`brew install sdl2`) - the real
                         # playable front end: video, keyboard input, live
                         # audio, and save states (F5/F9)
make clean               # remove object files and all built binaries
```

`bin/gameboy` takes a ROM path as argv[1]:

```
bin/gameboy test_roms/dmg-acid2/dmg-acid2.gb --ppm out.ppm --frames 2
```

See `bin/gameboy --help` for the full flag set (`--ppm`/`--wav`/
`--input`/`--load-state`/`--save-state`), and `README.md`'s "Playing"
section (or `bin/gameboy-sdl --help`) for the SDL front end's key
bindings.

Correctness is verified two ways, both grounded rather than
self-referential: **real ROMs** (`test_roms/` - open-source homebrew
games and PPU/APU/hardware test suites, each with its own committed
license and a `README.md` documenting exactly what it tests and any
bug it found) compared byte-for-byte against known-good captured output
where possible, and **direct unit tests** (`tests/`) for behavior a
whole-ROM comparison can't isolate cleanly (a specific hardware quirk,
a save-state field, a timer edge case). Every bug fix in this project's
history added a regression test of one of these two kinds alongside
the fix itself, not after the fact - see `docs/GAMEBOY_ROADMAP.md`'s
Status section for the specific real bugs each one caught.

`roms/` is real cartridge dumps - gitignored, **never committed, not
even to a private repo** (Nintendo's copyrighted work, unlike 1980s
CP/M software's much murkier situation - see `README.md`). `test_roms/`
is the opposite: open-source, explicitly-licensed test content, safe to
commit and already committed.

## Conventions

- Ground every technical claim in a real primary source (pandocs for
  Game Boy hardware, the actual upstream ROM/tool source for anything
  cited from it) - never guess at hardware behavior.
- Verify a ROM's license against its real, linked repository (not just
  a database's claim) before committing it - see `README.md` and any
  `test_roms/*/README.md` for the standard this project already holds
  itself to.
- Pair every bug fix with a regression test - a real ROM's observed
  behavior where one exists, a direct unit test where it doesn't (see
  `tests/test_apu.c`/`test_cpu.c`/`test_savestate.c` for recent
  examples of the latter).
- Document honest findings even when a fix doesn't achieve the hoped-for
  result (see `docs/GAMEBOY_ROADMAP.md`'s Phase 8 entry for a concrete
  example: a real, additive timing fix that turned out *not* to close
  `dmg-acid2`'s remaining visual gap, and says so directly rather than
  overstating the result).
